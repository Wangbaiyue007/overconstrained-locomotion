# overconstrained-locomotion

* This is my Undergraduate thesis. This work investegated possible locomotion of an overconstrained leg.
* This work has some initial results of monopod hopping with overconstrained leg; however, it is restricted to a sagittal plane. An independent robot with overconstrained leg must has at least 2 legs. Therefore, future works are expected to solve possible biped/quadruped locomotion.
* Details of this work can be seen in *docs\sustechthesis_WangBY_UG21.pdf*

## Bennett's four-bar linkage

This is an exapmle, or the source of our ispiration, of a Bennett's linkage.

## Overconstrained leg

The overconstrained leg is literally half of the four-bar linkage. The first two joints 1 and 2 are chosen to be actuation.

## Controller design through templates composition

We first studied a monopod with overconstrained leg. Its frontal plane and sagittal plane view is shown below:

</div>

Controlling this monopod jumping in a sagittal plane requires consideration of its foot placement that is not directly underneath the body. $\delta$ here is the angle of projection from leg to YZ plane. The hopping controller is inspired by PennJerboa [<sup>1</sup>](#penn-jerboa) and some other works [<sup>2</sup>](#raibert) [<sup>3</sup>](#BHop) [<sup>4</sup>](#Analysis).

## Results
Here are some initial results of the monopod hopping in the sagittal plane.
